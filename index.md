# Generating high-quanlity symbolic music using fine-grained discriminators

## Abstract

Existing symbolic music generation methods utilize a discriminator to distinguish generated music from human-composed one based on a global perception of the music. However, a piece of music usually contains two main components: pitch and rhythm, which cannot be well measured at the same time by one discriminator. In this work, we propose to decouple rhythm and pitch, and design a fine-grained multi-discriminator architecture to tackle this issue.  Specifically, we design a pitch discriminator and a rhythm  discriminator. Equipped with a pitch augmentation strategy,  the pitch discriminator discerns the pitch distribution and  variations presented by the generated samples. By contrast,  the rhythm discriminator enhanced with bar-level relative  positional encodings focuses on the progression and velocity variations of the notes. Such a design allows the generator  to be more clearly aware of which aspect should be adjusted  of the generated music, rendering a ease to mimic human-composed music. Experimental results on the POP909 benchmark demonstrate the favorable performance of the proposed  method compared to several state-of-the-art symbolic music  generation models in terms of both objective and subjective  metrics. 

## The theoretical foundation in the field of music perception

> **Rhythm and pitch are the 2 primary dimensions of music. They are interesting psychologically because simple, well-defined units combine to form highly complex and varied patterns.** This article brings together the major developments in research on how these dimensions are perceived and remembered, beginning with psychophysical results on time and pitch perception. Progressively larger units are considered, moving from basic psychological categories of temporal and frequency ratios, to pulse and scale, to metrical and tonal hierarchies, to the formation of musical rhythms and melodies, and finally to the cognitive representation of large-scale musical form. Interactions between the dimensions are considered, and major theoretical proposals are described. The article identifies various links between musical structure and perceptual and cognitive processes, suggesting psychological influences on how sounds are patterned in music.
